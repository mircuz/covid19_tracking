# COVID19 Pandemia Evolution Tracker
The situation of this pandemia has upset our lives. 
To better understand the entity of this situation and provide a visual feedback I decided to produce
a couple of interactive Python scripts.
One is specifically for Italy, and uses information of Protezione Civile. 
The second one allows to choose the country/countries in which you are interested in.
The latter uses a combination of data from WHO and regional data,
combined in a single dataframe(Credits of this dataframe goes to the author).

The script is really simple and does not require any programmation effort, 
the only requirements is a working iPython environment. 
For this purpose I suggest to download and install Anaconda Environment and run the code in Jupyter.
